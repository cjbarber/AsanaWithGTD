### How to use Getting Things Done (GTD) with Asana

**Projects**

 - Create new Projects for each GTD project. Relatively straightforward.

**Next Actions**

 - Add next actions to their relevant project, as well as it's context project.

 - If a relevant project doesn't exist, then just add it to the context project.

**Contexts**

 - Use Projects. Remember, you can add a task to multiple projects.

**Waiting For**

 - Create a Waiting For project.

**General Tips**

 - If this is for personal use, create a new workspace called Personal. Don't use the Personal Projects workspace, where tags are unfortunately not available.

 - If you are doing this within a company workspace, you can make projects in teams that are private to you (e.g. Waiting For). This way, you don't have a Waiting For project in the company workspace that everyone can see. To do this, see the [Private to you section on this Asana support article](https://asana.com/guide/learn/basics/permissions).

 - Make use of the today/upcoming sections. Always hide new, upcoming and later. Always mark your today tasks as today so they show up in the today section.

**Thoughts/Undecided**

 - May go back on using Projects for contexts, in favor of tags. In which case, I would create a Next Action project.
